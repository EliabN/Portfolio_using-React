            I am a very passionate and current student in Information Technology (Programming) student Development. As a result, I am a versatile thinker and an effective communicator with string problem solving, conflict resolution and an eye for detail.

            Currently seeking an opportunity to develop my skills and push me out of my comfort zone and knowledge set. Having a great passion for programming and problem solving, I believe I am self-driven and motivated as I apply my technical writing skills and IT experience and knowledge to your organization.
